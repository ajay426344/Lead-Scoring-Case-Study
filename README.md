## Lead-Scoring-Case-Study

##Summary Report

This repository contains the code and documentation for a lead scoring case study using a logistic regression model. The goal of the project is to align with specific business requirements and improve the conversion rates of leads into paying customers. The following key insights were derived from the analysis:

    #Logistic Regression Model:
        A logistic regression model was employed to predict the likelihood of lead conversion based on various features.

    #Lead Distribution:
        Despite a substantial volume of leads in the initial stage, only a small fraction converts into paying customers.
        The majority of leads are from India, with Mumbai having the highest concentration.

    #Data Cleansing:
        In certain columns, such as Customer Occupation and Specialization, the value 'Select' indicates that the user did not make a selection. It is crucial to enforce the selection of these options to obtain meaningful data.

    #Engagement Metrics:
        Higher total visits and longer time spent on the platform may increase the likelihood of a lead being converted.

    #Specialization Insights:
        Leads who have enrolled in courses for better career prospects often specialize in Finance Management.
        There is a higher probability of conversion among leads with specializations in HR, Finance, and Marketing Management.

    #Customer Engagement Strategies:
        Enhancing customer engagement through email and calls, based on the last notable activity, can improve lead conversion rates.
        Leads who engage with emails have a higher conversion probability, and leveraging SMS communication can also be beneficial.

    #Unemployed Segment Focus:
        Since a significant portion of leads is currently unemployed, there should be a focus on understanding and engaging with this segment.
