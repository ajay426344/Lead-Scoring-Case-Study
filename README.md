## Lead-Scoring-Case-Study

*SUMMARY REPORT*

1.	A logistic regression model was utilized in a lead scoring case study to align with the specific business requirements.
2.	Although there is a substantial volume of leads in the initial stage, only a small fraction of them converts into paying customers. The majority of leads are from India, with Mumbai having the highest concentration.
3.	In certain columns, such as Customer Occupation and Specialization, the value 'Select' indicates that the user did not make a selection. To obtain meaningful data, it is necessary to enforce the selection of these options.
4.	Higher total visits and longer time spent on the platform may increase the likelihood of a lead being converted.
5.	Leads who have enrolled in courses for better career prospects often specialize in Finance Management. There is a higher probability of conversion among leads with specializations in HR, Finance, and Marketing Management.
6.	Enhancing customer engagement through email and calls, based on the last notable activity, can improve lead conversion rates. Leads who engage with emails have a higher conversion probability, and leveraging SMS communication can also be beneficial.
7.	Since a significant portion of leads is currently unemployed, there should be a focus on understanding and engaging with this segment.
